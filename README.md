> **Warning**
> This resource pack is only valid under the integrated server, launched when you play the game from the launcher.
> This is because the language instance is shared between the client and the integrated server threads, but this is not the case with the dedicated server.
> To use this resource pack in the dedicated server (`server.jar`), you have to directly modify `/META-INF/versions/<version>/server-<version>.jar/assets/minecraft/lang/en_us.json` and delete `/META-INF/versions/<version>/server-<version>.jar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

This resource pack improves performance when commands fail by replacing all the translation values used in command exceptions with an empty string.
